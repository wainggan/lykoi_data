# lykoi_data

various small, minimally implemented data structures and utilities.

all modules are exported with individual features, of which all are enabled by default.

exported modules/features:
- `rng` - a few psuedo-rng implementations
- `dag` - a "directed acyclic graph"
- `point` - a mathematical vector
- `sod` - a real time animation tool using "second order dynamics"
- `color` - a basic rgb/oklab color representation
- `math` - simple math utilities and functions

good luck.
